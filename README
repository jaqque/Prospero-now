You will need to update your infobot.config 
and infobot.users.  See the example files.

This requires perl 5.

You should be able to start up just by running
infobot.  If you are using macperl, you will
(currently) have to make one minor change (because
$^O didn't work for me under os8).

The infobot uses parameter files, typically in the
params directory, to set up with.  It treats anything
on the command line as a parameter file and tries to 
load it. 

If you are using macperl, you will want to set 
the value of the macperl parameter to 1 in the
two given param files (in the 'files' dir).

By default, the infobot uses the IRC setup.  This
may change.  NOTE that the irc version has no output
by default; you'll have to turn up the debug level
to get more.

to start up the infobot, just invoke it from the 
command line.

A note on forms:  you can prepend the tag <reply>
to values in the db to just get a reply with no 
extra info.

e.g.

   x => <reply> y

then when you ask 'x?' it will just reply 'y' instead
of something like "i think x is y".

* extending the bot by adding your own code

try to keep your changes inside src/myRoutines.pl
so that you can easily just replace this file when 
there are new revs.  this is called just after some
of the normalization stuff in urlProcess.pl. take
a look at the file for details.

basically, if myRoutines returns non-null, it's
taken to have 'caught' the event.  you can just
return '' to let the rest of the processing go at
it.

* update_db & dump_db

update_db is a little perl script that will take a
flat ascii file and make an infobot-style db out
of it (currently just a couple of dbm files). You'll
want to make 2, even if theye contain only 1 element
each.  it will also simply add (and overwrite entries
in) existing dbs.  This is especially nice if
you don't allow updates to the databases through IRC
and just want a collection of permanent factoids.

update_db <inputfile> <dbname>

where <inputfile> is an ascii file like (in the case
of an url-style infobot):

infobot => at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/hocus.html

one key => value per line.  In the current setup,
you need an is-database and an are-database, mainly
for legacy reasons about representing plurality and
being able to give the proper form.  in the infobot-is.txt
file and infobot-are.txt files you have examples.  these
are a fine starting point:

1.1  update_db infobot-is.txt infobot-is
     update_db infobot-are.txt infobot-are

2. Now you need to edit infobot to set up your bot.
   Don't forget to set the path to perl properly at
   the top and make it executable.

3. Then try running infobot.  At present, there's a
   bunch of VERY BAD code in it, so don't use the -w
   switch unless you want to fix a bunch of things and
   mail me.

Eventually, kill it and then you'll probably
want to crontab it.  included is a sample crontab
and the script that you will need to edit.

dump_db <dbname> 

will just make a flat ascii file out of the named db,
e.g.

   dump_db infobot-is

Both update_db and dump_db take an optional switch, -m, which tells them
what DBM module to use.  You'll need to specify this if you set
DBMModule in your config file in order to get the bot to use something
other than Perl's default.  Eg,

   update_db -m DB_File infobot-is.txt infobot-is
   dump_db   -m DB_File infobot-is

good luck, and mail me!

ps - i am just releasing this _now_ instead of waiting
     to fix everything.  If you use this and like it,
     or even if you don't, please mail me!
